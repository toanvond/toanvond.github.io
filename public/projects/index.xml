      <title>Workspace Manager</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, I worked with a team to develop Workspace Manager, a tool designed to streamline workflow by allowing users to create and manage custom workspaces. The goal of the application was to help users quickly launch all the necessary applications, files, and tools for specific tasks with just one click, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for a coding session, a design project, or content creation. This project was built using JavaScript and MongoDB as the backend database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application supports multiple users, each with the ability to create personalized workspaces. With password-encrypted accounts, it ensures secure access and keeps your workspace configurations private. Users can easily add and store multiple file paths and applications within each workspace, so everything you need for a particular task is just a single action away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Password encryption
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, Workspace Manager relies on MongoDB to handle data storage efficiently. When a user sets up their custom workspace, the application saves all file paths, application preferences, and user settings in the MongoDB database. This database structure allows for quick retrieval of information, making it easy for the application to launch the desired tools and files together when prompted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The back-end logic, built with JavaScript, manages these interactions by communicating with the database to fetch the necessary data and execute commands to open the applications. This ensures a smooth and secure experience, as the password-encrypted accounts are also managed through MongoDB, safeguarding user configurations and workspaces. The front-end interface, developed with ClackJS, provides a seamless user experience, handling user inputs and delivering responses quickly by leveraging the data stored in MongoDB. Together, these components work in harmony to offer a streamlined and efficient workspace setup process.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;rsquo;s an invaluable tool for anyone looking to enhance their workflow, reducing the setup time and allowing you to work more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Impact of attendance on SAT scores</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/sat-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/sat-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This analysis delves into the relationship between school attendance and SAT scores in New York high schools using data from 2010. The primary aim was to determine if higher attendance rates have a significant impact on students&amp;rsquo; SAT performance and to explore potential differences between SAT reading and writing scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study utilized two datasets: the SAT College Board 2010 results, which included mean scores for reading, writing, and math, and daily attendance records from the NYC Department of Education. By applying regression analysis, the research investigated the correlation between the average SAT scores and school attendance rates. Additionally, hypothesis testing was used to determine if there were statistically significant differences between the SAT reading and writing scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact of Attendance on SAT Scores: Our regression model revealed a positive relationship between school attendance and total SAT scores (sum of reading, writing, and math). The linear regression model predicted that a school with 100% attendance would have an average total SAT score of 1395.292. However, the residual plot suggested that the relationship may be non-linear, indicating that a quadratic model could better represent the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;flex justify-center	&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;SAT analysis&#34; srcset=&#34;
               /projects/sat-analysis/image_hu7e6c32e0069a5525a73dfb2dda39dc03_28189_f1e4a3204f3468f6280d8ace3cf0c081.webp 400w,

               /projects/sat-analysis/image_hu7e6c32e0069a5525a73dfb2dda39dc03_28189_1200x1200_fit_q80_h2_lanczos_3.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/projects/sat-analysis/image_hu7e6c32e0069a5525a73dfb2dda39dc03_28189_f1e4a3204f3468f6280d8ace3cf0c081.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;760&#34;
               height=&#34;543&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference Between SAT Reading and Writing Scores: Through hypothesis testing, we found a significant difference between mean SAT reading and writing scores (p-value &amp;lt; 2.2e-16). The mean difference was about 6.54 points, with reading scores typically higher than writing scores. This suggests that improving reading scores does not necessarily result in equivalent gains in writing scores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis supported the idea that increased attendance has a positive impact on SAT performance, though further research is needed to explore the non-linear relationship indicated by the residuals. This project honed my skills in R programming, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing, while providing an opportunity to collaborate on meaningful educational research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Highway crossing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/highway-crossing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/projects/highway-crossing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Highway Crossing is an exciting 3D car game developed using C# and OpenGL, designed to challenge players as they navigate through busy highways filled with fast-moving traffic. The objective is simple yet engaging: guide your car safely across multiple lanes while avoiding collisions with other vehicles. As players progress through the game, they face increasingly difficult levels with more congested highways and faster-moving obstacles, requiring precise timing and strategic maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game features a range of 3D-rendered elements, including cars, roads, and various environmental objects, all created using OpenGL. The focus is on clear and functional visuals rather than hyper-realistic graphics, ensuring that players can easily identify obstacles and plan their movements. This design choice enhances the gameplay experience by providing a visually engaging world that supports the fast-paced nature of the game. To further immerse players, audio effects are integrated into the game, with sounds for engine revs and collisions adding to the overall atmosphere and making each drive feel more intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Texture
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highway Crossing also incorporates responsive controls and dynamic obstacles, ensuring that each playthrough offers a unique and challenging experience. Players must quickly adapt to changing traffic patterns and obstacles, testing their reflexes and strategic thinking. The game&amp;rsquo;s collision detection system ensures smooth interactions with the environment, making it a test of skill and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout development, we collaborated closely, solving challenges such as optimizing object collisions, creating responsive controls, and synchronizing audio with gameplay. The project not only deepened my understanding of OpenGL and C#, but also honed my skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and game mechanics development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Highway Crossing offers a blend of strategy, action, and quick reflexes within an engaging 3D environment. It demonstrates the potential of using C# and OpenGL to create interactive, enjoyable gaming experiences, providing a thrilling adventure for players as they race through congested highways.&lt;/p&gt;
